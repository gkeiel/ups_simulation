# UPS simulation and control

A program for simulation and control of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. Considering an output stage comprising a half-bridge voltage source inverter (VSI) and output LC filter, it allows evaluating the operation of such electronic device under high-frequency switching and for different load conditions.
