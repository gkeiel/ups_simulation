# UPS simulation and control

A program for simulation and control of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. Considering an output stage comprising a half-bridge voltage source inverter (VSI) and output LC filter, it allows evaluating the operation of such electronic device under high-frequency switching and for different load configurations.

The program contains the following file types:
- MATLAB scripts for settings and controller design
- Simulink model for controller
- PSIM of UPS system

Main file named as 'run_ups.m'.
